# Lisk pool distribution software for lwf
This software is created by lisk delegate "dakk", please consider a small donation if you
use this software: 
- "2324852447570841050L" for lisk
- "7725849364280821971S" for shift
- "AZAXtswaWS4v8eYMzJRjpd5pN3wMBj8Rmk" for ark
- "8691988869124917015R" for rise


## Configuration
Fork this repo; edit config.json and modify the first lines with your settings:

- pubkey: your delegate pubkey
- percentage: percentage to distribute
- secret: your secret
- secondsecret: your second secret or null if disabled
- node: the lisk node where you get forging info
- nodepay: the lisk node used for payments
- minpayout: the minimum amount for a payout
- coin: the name of the coin (LISK, ARK, SHIFT, RISE, or whatever you want)
- skip: a list of address to skip
- donations: a list of object (address: amount) for send static amount every payout
- donationspercentage: a list of object (address: percentage) for send static percentage every payout
- logfile: file where you want to write pending and sent amounts
- feededuct: true if you want to subtract fees from user payouts

Now edit docs/index.html and customize the webpage.

Finally edit poollogs_example.json and put in lastpayout the unixtimestamp of your last payout or the
date of pool starting; then move poollogs_example.json to poollogs.json.

### Private pool
If you want to run a private pool, you need to edit config.json and:

- private: set to true
- whitelist: put a list of address you wish to include

### Ark & Kapu
If you are using this software on ark, you should edit pollogs_example_ark.json and put:

- lastpayout: the unixtimestamp of your last payout or the date of pool starting 
- lastforged: the forged amount recorded in your last payout or the forged amount of pool starting

then move poollogs_example_ark.json to poollogs.json.

Also, replace docs/index.html with docs/index.ark.html

## Running it

First clone the lisk-pool repository and install requests:

```git clone https://github.com/dakk/lisk-pool```

```cd lisk-pool```

```apt-get install python3-pip```

```pip3 install requests```

If you are using lisk 1.0.0 or rise 1.0.0 you need to dpos-api-fallback:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vekexasia/dpos-api-fallback
cd dpos-api-fallback
npm install
npm run package
```

Then start it:

```python3 liskpool.py```

or if you want to use another config file:

```python3 liskpool.py -c config2.json```

It produces a file "payments.sh" with all payments shell commands. Run this file with:

```bash payments.sh```

The payments will be broadcasted (every 10 seconds). At the end you can move your generated
poollogs.json to docs/poollogs.json and send the update to your git repo.

To display the pool frontend, enable docs-site on github repository settings.


## Batch mode

The script is also runnable by cron using the -y argument:

`python3 liskpool.py -y`

There is also a 'batch.sh' file which run liskpool, then payments.sh and copy the poollogs.json
in the docs folder.


### Avoid vote hoppers

In some DPOS, some voters switch their voting weight from one delegate to another for
receiving payout from multiple pools. A solution for that is the following flow:

1. Run liskpool.py every hour with --min-payout=1000000 (a very high minpayout, so no payouts will be done but the pending will be updated)
2. Run liskpool.py normally to broadcast the payments


## Command line usage

```
usage: liskpool.py [-h] [-c config.json] [-y] [--min-payout MINPAYOUT]

DPOS delegate pool script

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c config.json        set a config file (default: config.json)
  -y                    automatic yes for log saving (default: no)
  --min-payout MINPAYOUT
                        override the minpayout value from config file
```

## Lisk 1.0.0 and Rise 1.0.0 migration

Since Lisk version 1.0.0 and Rise version 1.0.0, APIs with secret used for creating 
transaction are not available anymore, so we need to use the dpos-api-fallback
(a special thanks for vekexasia who made this tool). 

First, update the lisk-pool source, then install dpos-api-fallback inside the lisk-pool
directory:

```bash
cd lisk-pool
git clone https://github.com/vekexasia/dpos-api-fallback
cd dpos-api-fallback
npm install
npm run package
```

**nodejs >= 6 is mandatory for running dpos-api-fallback!**

Since this version is not yet the default, you should edit liskpool.py and set
the variable ENABLE_VERSION_1 to true:

```python
ENABLE_VERSION_1 = True
```
